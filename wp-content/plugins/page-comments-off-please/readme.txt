2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' admin menu in WordPress and the checkboxes will be off next time you go to create a page.
3. Use the settings page in ( Settings -> Page Comments )  in order to change the default behavior to to disable all page comments.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Is this different from the old plugin? =

If you just install it and leave the settings alone, it will continue to work the way you are familiar.  You may be interested in the mass-disable function on the settings page for when you already have comments on your pages.

= How do I set the preference to turn the default comment status for pages off or on? =

It is located under Settings->Page Comments.  Enjoy!

= What is 'Legacy Mode' for? =

This is provided as a backup method for some themes or wordpress customizations prohibit the normal method of operation. If the plugin is not working, try legacy mode :)

= Does the mass-page-comment toggle link affect my posts? =

No.  This only affects pages, regardless of the Page Comment Default checkboxes above.
